Technical term	:	Description
Monochrome	:	An image in black and white or varying tones of only one colour (for example, different shades of green - green, lime, pear, pine, etc.)
PMS	:	Pantone Matching System.
Process colour	:	 The process colours are Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK). The printer combines these base colours to create different colours.
RGB	:	The color space of Red, Green and Blue which computers use to display images on your screen. An RGB computer file must be translated into CMYK in order to be printed accurately.
Spot colour	:	This is achieved by actually mixing ink into the desired colour you want in your print project, as opposed to using the CMYK process to achieve it.
Spot varnish	:	A way of highlighting a certain area of a page by selectively applying a varnish to it.
Tint	:	The process of adding the colour white to another colour. So, when printed, the colour is lighter and more white shines through.
